    "Since we are working once again with a damped driven pendulum, start by copying over your `deriv()` and your `solveDDP()` functions from last week's lab (Lab 11). Then numerically find the solution to a damped driven pendulum with $\\phi$(t = 0) = -$\\pi$/2 and d$\\phi$/dt (t = 0) = 0 for 0 < t < 30. As in last week's exercise, set the angular frequency of the driving force ($\\Omega_D$) to 2$\\pi$, producing a drive period of $2 \\pi / \\Omega_D = 1$ s. Set the natural frequency ($\\omega_0$) to 1.5$\\Omega_D$, and set the damping constant ($\\beta = \\frac{\\omega_0}{4}$. You will be varying the drive strength ($\\gamma_D$) but for now set it to **$\\gamma_D = 0.7$**. Let the mass of the pendulum and the length of the pendulum be 1 (in the appropriate units).  Look over your `solveDDP()` function and modify it, if necessary, to use fixed time steps, e.g., $\\Delta t = 0.01$. You may choose to use `arange()` rather than `linspace()` to form your time array to make it easier to choose $\\Delta t$. Later, when we carry the integration for longer times, we can keep the same resolution, but increase the total number of steps."
