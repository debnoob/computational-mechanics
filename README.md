# Computational Physics
Here you'll find a sampling of my computational mechanics labs (pair-programmed in Grinnell College Computational Physics lab) as well as assorted snippets and side projects. Most of the code is in Python, and written using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

## Play with Jupyter files
For the Jupyter files (indicated by .ipynb), you can browse the Python code on GitHub or play with it on Binder.
